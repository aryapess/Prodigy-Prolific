The model is designed to harness the capabilities of the  latest generative AI technologies, including large language models  (LLMs) and multimodal generative models (MMMs), to build autonomous,  agentic systems.

This paper introduces the Autonomous  Cognitive Entity (ACE) model, a novel framework for a cognitive  architecture, enabling machines and software agents to operate more  independently. Drawing inspiration from the OSI model, the ACE framework  presents layers of abstraction to conceptualize artificial cognitive  architectures. The model is designed to harness the capabilities of the  latest generative AI technologies, including large language models  (LLMs) and multimodal generative models (MMMs), to build autonomous,  agentic systems. The ACE framework comprises six layers: the  Aspirational Layer, Global Strategy, Agent Model, Executive Function,  Cognitive Control, and Task Prosecution. Each layer plays a distinct  role, ranging from setting the moral compass and strategic thinking to  task selection and execution. The ACE framework also incorporates  mechanisms for handling failures and adapting actions, thereby enhancing  the robustness and flexibility of autonomous agents.
